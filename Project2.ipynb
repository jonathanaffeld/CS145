Also note that the consecutive number is the code for the crash, which includes all cars involved in that particular accident. We will also use this identification number to join all the other tables to make the dataset more robust.

We realized this would pose several issues when we are joining these tables to the accident tables. Moreover we had to account for the fact that if there are multiple participants within an accident there will be multiple entries for a specific accident id number e.g. if there is a head-on collision, there will be row entries for both drivers in drimpair table under the same accident ID that states if either driver was physically impaired or not. This resulted in certain specific crashes having thousands of different entries after joining on multiple different tables due to the sheer amount of permutations. Therefore we decided to cut down on the number of feature tables we use to just two, DISTRACT and DRIMPAIR. However the same issues persisted, the mismatch of number of entries per crash would make the data very confusing etc. Therefore the only way to incorporate other tables to accidents would be to count number of impairments, or maneuvers for a unique accident. However we decided that this would abstract the data too much such that it wouldn't be meaningful anymore. Therefore we are sticking just to joining the accident tables across all years except 2015.
