What factors might contribute to these regional variations?\n","\n","**PROJECT OVERVIEW**\n","\n","We are using the nhtsa_traffic_fatalities data set to find which factors significantly increase the severity of fatal crashes such as atmospheric conditions, emergency response times and how it differs across state. To do this we will try to find out how a wide range of factors along with their combinations, along with a way to measure the severity of a fatal accident. Moreover we want to find which are the most common factors that are involved within car accidents. \n","\n","**SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS**\n","- Are the number of deaths in a crash determined by the emergency response time? Perhaps the severity of a crash may be very contingent upon the effectiveness of emergency services or proximity to hospitals where emergency care can be provided. And does emergency response time on average differ from state to state?\n","\n","- What times/days are the most fatal, and what proportion of those crashes during those times involve drunk drivers. We wonder if there are more drunk drivers in certain states? And if hours with most fatal crashes vary across these states?\n","\n","- What atmospheric conditions cause a higher percentage of severe crashes? And do differences in unfavourable conditions across states increase number of fatal crashes in a statistically significant way?\n","\n","- Does maneuvering increase or decrease the number of fatalities in a crash? Or is it more of an indicator of whether or not someone is drunk/impaired?\n","Being alert may cause someone to swerve as opposed to being drunk/asleep, we also wonder if swerving leads to more or less deaths on the road.\n","\n","- Which contributing factors and their combinations are most common in severe/fatal crashes (find various permutations of contributing factors)? We want to know if a combination of factors such as being impaired + being distracted result or being impaired + swerving will result in more severe crashes \n","\n","\n","\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Analysis of Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install pandas\n","!pip install pandas-gbq\n","!pip install matplotlib\n","!pip install plotly\n","!pip install plotly-express"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import plotly_express as px"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MLik6i4DiG__"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Run this cell to authenticate yourself to BigQuery\n","from google.oauth2 import service_account\n","key_path = './cs145-project2-406000-9a59fc7c0b3d.json'\n","credential = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Initialize BiqQuery client\n","from google.cloud import bigquery\n","%load_ext google.cloud.bigquery\n","%env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$key_path\n","project_id = \"cs145-project2-406000\"\n","client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credential, project=project_id)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Taste of the Dataset (just using 2016)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["ACCIDENTS (~30mb each for 6 years - 180mb)\n","State_name (primary)\n","Number_of_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit (primary)\n","Number_of_parked_working_vehicles (primary)\n","Number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit (primary)\n","Number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit (primary)\n","City_name (primary)\n","Day_name (primary)\n","Month_of_crash_name (primary)\n","Day_of_week_name (primary)\n","Hour_of_crash_name (primary)\n","Route_signing_name (primary)\n","Land_use (primary) \n","Land_use_name (primary) *Very vague e.g. rural, urban etc.\n","First_harmful_event_name (primary) \n","Work_zone (primary)\n","Work_zone_name (primary)\n","Relation_to_trafficway_name (primary)\n","Light_condition_name (primary)\n","Atmospheric_conditions_name (primary)\n","Minute_of_arrival_at_scene (primary) *MAKE A NEW FEATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRASH TIME AND ARRIVAL AT SCENE\n","Minute_of_ems_arrival_at_hospital_name (primary) *MAKE A NEW FEATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRASH TIME AND ARRIVAL AT SCENE\n","Number_of_fatalities (primary)\n","Number_of_drunk_drivers (primary)\n","\n","ACCIDENTS is the main table of the dataset. It has a high level description of each crash e.g. when, where, and some description of the actual crash. Moreover it gives us a handful of other useful columns such as atmospheric condition which indicates if it was raining, cloudy etc. Another column like light_condition gives information on how bright or dark it is on a numerical scale (e.g. dark and lighted, dusk, daylight etc.). However the more interesting columns are the crash time and arrival of emergency services at the scene - which may give us a lot of insight into how the quickness of emergency response can help reduce the number of fatalities in a car accident. Also note that the consecutive number is the code for the crash, which includes all cars involved in that particular accident. We will also use this identification number to join all the other tables to make the dataset more robust. There are some data inconsistencies from year to year, but we are mainly choosing to exclude 2015 as there are a couple of columns missing from this dataset that we will be using.
