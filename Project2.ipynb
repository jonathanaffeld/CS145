The factors we will explore include the number of vehicles involved in a crash, the number of people involved in a crash, day of the week, hour, month, type of landuse, atmospheric conditions, time to scene of crash, time to hospital, and number of drunk drivers. \n","\n","**SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS**\n","- Are the number of deaths in a crash determined by the emergency response time? Perhaps the severity of a crash may be contingent upon the effectiveness of emergency services or proximity to hospitals where emergency care can be provided. And does emergency response time on average differ from state to state?\n","\n","- What times/days/months are the most fatal, and what proportion of those crashes during those times involve drunk drivers. We wonder if there are more drunk drivers in certain states? And if hours with most fatal crashes vary across these states?\n","\n","- What atmospheric conditions cause a higher percentage of fatal accidents? And do differences in unfavourable conditions across states increase number of fatal crashes in a statistically significant way?\n","\n","- How dependent is the severity of fatal car crashes on the number of drunk drivers in an accident?\n","\n","- Does the type of land effect the fatality rate across states?\n","\n","- How do the number of vehicles/people involved in fatal accidents effect the fatality rate?\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%pip install pandas\n","%pip install pandas-gbq\n","%pip install matplotlib\n","%pip install plotly\n","%pip install plotly-express"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import plotly_express as px"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MLik6i4DiG__"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Run this cell to authenticate yourself to BigQuery\n","from google.oauth2 import service_account\n","key_path = './cs145-project2-406000-9a59fc7c0b3d.json'\n","credential = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Initialize BiqQuery client\n","from google.cloud import bigquery\n","%load_ext google.cloud.bigquery\n","%env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$key_path\n","project_id = \"cs145-project2-406000\"\n","client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credential, project=project_id)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["----\n","## Analysis of Dataset - **nhtsa_fatalities**\n","----"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The nhtsa_fatalities data set contains 108 tables.

Therefore datasets that provide numbers on minor accidents and other non-fatal accidents might be innaccurate or provide estimates at best.

We felt that the more people to cars there are, the higher the potential for fatalitites.

And therefore to find the Emergency response time we found the difference between the two, accounting for different unit of measurement types (see time_to_scene below)\n","- Time_to_hospital - similarly, but we ended up finding this was less helpful as we predicted that in fatal accidents there might not be a lot of urgency especially if injured people in an accident are already dead.\n","\n","- Label - The label is constructed by computing the product of the number of fatalities to the ratio of number of total people to number of total cars\n","\n","FEATURES:\n","- state_number - the id number for a US state\n","- state_name - the name of the state\n","- number_of_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - details the number of moving vehicles involved in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_parked_working_vehicles - details the number of parked working vehicles that were hit in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - the number of people in moving vehicles that were in the accident\n","- number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - the number of people involved in accidents that aren't in motor vehicles\n","- month_of_crash - numerical value for month 1-12\n","- month_of_crash_name - name of month that accident occured\n","- day_of_week - number for day of week 1-7\n","- day_of_week_name - is the name of the day of the week e.g. monday etc. that crash occured\n","- hour_of_crash - is the hour in which an accident occured e.g. 23 -> 11pm \n","- hour_of_crash_name - the name of the hour\n","- land_use = codes for landuse e.g. 1 = \"urban\", 2 = \"rural\"\n","- land_use_name - \"urban\", \"rural\" etc.\n","- atmospheric_conditions - integer code for atmospheric condition\n","- atmospheric_conditions_1 - integer code for primary atmospheric condition only included in 2020 data \n","- atmospheric_conditions_name - details weather conditions the time of crash e.g. \"cloudy\", \"hail\", \"snow\", \"rain\" etc.\n","- atmospheric_conditions_1_name - details primary weather conditions the time of crash e.g. \"cloudy\", \"hail\", \"snow\", \"rain\" etc. only included in 2020 data \n","- number_of_drunk_drivers - the number of drunk drivers involved in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_fatalities - the number of fatalities within a given fatal accident\n","\n","Other Tables:\n","- `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.states` - gives us information on states including state abbreviation.

We also see that some states have Wednesday as the day with highest average fatalities and very few have Monday and Tuesday. Surprisingly, not a single state has Thursday as the day of the week with the highest fatality rate. \n","\n","For some states, the day of the week does appear to have a statistically significant effect on the fatality rate. Monday is Alaska's day with the highest fatality rate of 1.275. This is significantly higher than the national rate for Monday at 1.08. This tells us that the day of the week may play a factor into the fatality rate for some states. However, without knowing additional factors for each state such as cultural, social, or policy trends, we cannot decide what can be attributed to this difference. Each state's unique traffic dynamics play a pivotal role in shaping the day of the week with the highest average fatality rate. States experience diverse traffic volumes and densities, leading to fluctuations in accident rates on specific days. For instance, some regions witness intensified traffic on weekends due to increased recreational travel, potentially resulting in higher fatality rates, while others face heightened risks during weekdays due to commuter congestion. Varying work hours and commuting habits can influence traffic congestions and accident risks on specific days. Moreover, demographic factors such as age distribution and driving habits within each state further shape the deadliest days. Cultural and regional disparities also contribute significantly. Various states host distinct events or festivities on particular days, influencing travel behaviors and subsequently impacting accident probabilities. As a result this may be why we see that some states have wednesday as the day of the week with the highest average number of fatalities per fatal crash. Additionally, the enforcement of traffic laws and safety measures can vary, affecting driver conduct and accident rates across different days. Understanding these intricate interplays between traffic patterns, culture, enforcement policies, and regional factors would be key to offer insight into why states exhibit discrepancies in days with the highest average number of fatalities per car accident. But sadly we would need a much more robust data set here.\n","\n","Despite the lack of additional data for each state, we can determine that there does not appear to be a geological effect on the day of the week with the highest average fatality rate by state. This can be seen as the days of the week appear randomly distributed across the US rather than creating patterns among regions. Therefore, the day of the week does not appear to directly effect the state fatality rates."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Hour\n","We will now take a deep dive into how fatal accidents vary by hour, and by hour on specific days of the week.

have a common hour across states. There also does not appear to be any regional pattern with the hours. It appears that geolocation does not effect the hour with the most fatalities across states. However, looking at the proportion of fatalities for each state at the hour with the largest number of fatalities, we discover that the hour does have a statistically significant impact on the number of fatalities for the state. Take Vermont for example. The hour with the highest number of fatalities is 4:00pm-4:59pm and it makes up 9.6% of accidents across the day. This percentage is significantly higher than the national proportion of 5.2%.

The average fatality rate is statistically significant here when comparing the rates for each state (California 1.1, Oregon 1.15, Washington 1.1) to the rate across the country (1.09). This regional trend may be able to be explained by increased travel for tourism to the west coast durng the month of June. The midwest also has a regional trend in that much of the area's top month is December while Michigan has January. These months indicate a higher fatality rate during the winter months when the midwest recieves heavy snowfall.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Here, about 92% of the positive predictions made by the model were actually correct so our model predicts severe accidents well. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The model identified approximately 87% of all actual positive instances. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. The model achieved an accuracy of around 90%, indicating that it is fairly accurate. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F1 score is approximately 89%, suggesting a good balance between precision and recall.

With a log loss of roughly 0.35, the model's predictions are semi-confident but with room to improve. Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) measures the area under the ROC curve, which represents the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. The ROC AUC score of 0.94 indicates a high level of discrimination between positive and negative instances. If I were to improve one value, it would be the log loss. A log loss of 0.35 is servicable but shows the model has room for improvement.\n","\n","We originally got supbar results on the model when using a logistic regression model to classify the number of fatalities. The mdoel had high accuracy but low precision indicating it was poor at predicting any number of fatalities above one. Thus, we used the validation set to tune our hyperparameters and ultimately ended up on our new label. We want to address that the same problem that plagued our model when it was an evalutation model is still an issue with the newly defined label: the product of the number of fatalities to the ratio of number of total people to number of total cars. Since a large percent of the data had one car, one person and one fatality, the most common severe rating was one. Setting the label to be any severity above one, while dividing the dataset in half, made it easy to learn on. For example, when the model sees anything that has more than one person or one car, it can assume that it is a 'severe' accident."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Evalute the model on test set (last 20% of randomized data). 0.8 * 203465 ~ 136942"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%%bigquery --project $project_id\n","\n","# YOUR QUERY HERE\n","SELECT\n","  *\n","FROM\n","  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `traffic_fatalities.traffic_model`, (\n","      SELECT\n","        *\n","      FROM `traffic_fatalities.traffic_test_set`))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The model achieved very similar results on the test data.

This gives the model an 80% accuracy rate for these entries. The baseline KNN query also achieved an accuracy of 80% for these 10 values. Therefore the model matched the baseline accuracy that we set out for it to accomplish. The difference between the two prediction methods is in complexity.\n","\n","KNN has minimal training time because it simply stores the training data. KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it doesn't explicitly \"train\" on the data during the training phase. The majority of the computation occurs during prediction. Therefore, the prediction time in KNN can be higher, especially as the dataset size increases. Each prediction involves calculating distances between all combinations of training accidents and prediction accidents. As the inputted data sets get larger, the prediction time grows exponentially. On the other hand, training a Logistic Regression model involves iterative optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent). The training time can vary based on the convergence speed and the size of the dataset but will generally be more complex than that of a KNN algorithm. Logistic Regression generally has lower prediction time compared to KNN, especially for large datasets. Prediction for a new instance is typically a simple linear operation. \n","\n","KNN's I/O costs during prediction can be significant, as it needs to compare and store each query instance against all training instances. For large datasets, this can lead to a higher I/O cost. As such, the computational cost for KNN scales with the number of training instances, and using larger datasets can result in higher cloud computing costs due to increased computation and I/O operations. Logistic Regression typically has lower I/O costs since it involves a simple linear operation based on learned weights without storing any data (besides the weights). The training cost for Logistic Regression can be influenced by the size of the dataset. So, we see that the I/O and monetary costs increase with both the training and prediction phase of KNN as the dataset gets larger whereas the I/O and monetary costs of logistic regression is only reliant on the training step.\n","\n","Logistic Regression is generally more scalable for large datasets, as its training and prediction times are less affected by the dataset size compared to KNN. Logistic Regression provides interpretable coefficients, which can be valuable for understanding feature importance. KNN, being a non-parametric method, doesn't offer straightforward interpretability."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Conclusion"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","\n","*TODO: Final conclusions based on the rest of your project*\n","\n","---"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyP84sdwCjnfi3SgVDi4fYu9","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
