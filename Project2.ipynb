We could do so much more with a dataset that included accidents with and without fatalities. Nevertheless we decided to artificially make a label variable that estimates the severity of a crash. Based on the above data we let the severity = 1* number of parked vehicles + 2*number of vehicles in transport + 4*number of fatalities. This is because vehicles that are parked are less likely to have occupants. Moreover we think the number of injuries and damage caused will greatly increase with number of moving vehicles in the crash. Finally we weight the number of fatalities in an accident the most for obvious reasons. Below we see that the data is biased towards \"low severity fatal accidents\".
