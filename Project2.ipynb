And does emergency response time on average differ from state to state?\n","\n","- What hours/days/months are the most fatal? And what proportion of those crashes during those times involve drunk drivers? Does the percent of drunk drivers vary across states? And do different states have different fatality rates across hours/days/months?\n","\n","- What atmospheric conditions increas fatality rate? And do differences in unfavourable conditions across states increase number of fatal crashes in a statistically significant way?\n","\n","- How dependent are the number of fatalities in an accident on the number of drunk drivers in those accidents?\n","\n","- Does the type of land effect the fatality rate across states?

And therefore to find the Emergency response time we found the difference between the two, accounting for different unit of measurement types (see time_to_scene below)\n","- Time_to_hospital - similarly, but we ended up finding this was less helpful as we predicted that in fatal accidents there might not be a lot of urgency especially if injured people in an accident are already dead.\n","\n","- Label - The label is constructed by computing the product of the number of fatalities to the ratio of number of total people to number of total cars\n","\n","FEATURES:\n","- state_number - the id number for a US state\n","- state_name - the name of the state\n","- number_of_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - details the number of moving vehicles involved in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_parked_working_vehicles - details the number of parked working vehicles that were hit in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - the number of people in moving vehicles that were in the accident\n","- number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit - the number of people involved in accidents that aren't in motor vehicles\n","- month_of_crash - numerical value for month 1-12\n","- month_of_crash_name - name of month that accident occured\n","- day_of_week - number for day of week 1-7\n","- day_of_week_name - is the name of the day of the week e.g. monday etc. that crash occured\n","- hour_of_crash - is the hour in which an accident occured e.g. 23 -> 11pm \n","- hour_of_crash_name - the name of the hour\n","- land_use = codes for landuse e.g. 1 = \"urban\", 2 = \"rural\"\n","- land_use_name - \"urban\", \"rural\" etc.\n","- atmospheric_conditions - integer code for atmospheric condition\n","- atmospheric_conditions_1 - integer code for primary atmospheric condition only included in 2020 data \n","- atmospheric_conditions_name - details weather conditions the time of crash e.g. \"cloudy\", \"hail\", \"snow\", \"rain\" etc.\n","- atmospheric_conditions_1_name - details primary weather conditions the time of crash e.g. \"cloudy\", \"hail\", \"snow\", \"rain\" etc. only included in 2020 data \n","- number_of_drunk_drivers - the number of drunk drivers involved in a fatal accident\n","- number_of_fatalities - the number of fatalities within a given fatal accident\n","\n","Other Tables:\n","- `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.states` - gives us information on states including state abbreviation.

We also see that some states have Wednesday as the day with highest average fatalities and very few have Monday and Tuesday. Surprisingly, not a single state has Thursday as the day of the week with the highest fatality rate. \n","\n","For some states, the day of the week does appear to have a statistically significant effect on the fatality rate. Monday is Alaska's day with the highest fatality rate of 1.275. This is significantly higher than the national rate for Monday at 1.08. This tells us that the day of the week may play a factor into the fatality rate for some states. However, without knowing additional factors for each state such as cultural, social, or policy trends, we cannot decide what can be attributed to this difference. Each state's unique traffic dynamics play a pivotal role in shaping the day of the week with the highest average fatality rate. States experience diverse traffic volumes and densities, leading to fluctuations in accident rates on specific days. For instance, some regions witness intensified traffic on weekends due to increased recreational travel, potentially resulting in higher fatality rates, while others face heightened risks during weekdays due to commuter congestion. Varying work hours and commuting habits can influence traffic congestions and accident risks on specific days. Moreover, demographic factors such as age distribution and driving habits within each state further shape the deadliest days. Cultural and regional disparities also contribute significantly. Various states host distinct events or festivities on particular days, influencing travel behaviors and subsequently impacting accident probabilities. As a result this may be why we see that some states have wednesday as the day of the week with the highest average number of fatalities per fatal crash. Additionally, the enforcement of traffic laws and safety measures can vary, affecting driver conduct and accident rates across different days. Understanding these intricate interplays between traffic patterns, culture, enforcement policies, and regional factors would be key to offer insight into why states exhibit discrepancies in days with the highest average number of fatalities per car accident. But sadly we would need a much more robust data set here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Despite the lack of additional data for each state, we can determine that there does not appear to be a geological effect on the day of the week with the highest average fatality rate by state.

More people tend to travel during this time, leading to increased traffic on roads, highways, and interstates, thereby raising the likelihood of accidents.\n","\n","- Tourism and Outdoor Activities: Warmer weather in summer encourages outdoor activities and tourism, leading to higher numbers of vehicles on the road, especially in areas known for tourist attractions or outdoor events.\n","\n","- Longer Daylight Hours: Longer daylight hours during summer months allow for extended periods of driving, potentially increasing the overall exposure to road risks.\n","\n","- Road Work and Construction: Construction and road repair projects are often more active during summer due to favorable weather conditions, which can lead to altered traffic patterns, detours, and temporary road layouts, contributing to accidents.\n","\n","- Youth Activities and Events: Summer break for schools and colleges means increased activity among young drivers, potentially leading to more accidents involving inexperienced or youthful drivers.\n","\n","- Alcohol Consumption: Holidays and warmer weather often lead to more social gatherings and outdoor events where alcohol consumption might be higher, contributing to an increased risk of accidents due to impaired driving."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next, we analyze the top month with the most fatalities for each

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The model identified approximately 56% of all actual positive instances. This means that our classification model is not very good at classifying severe accidents when it should. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

With a log loss of roughly 0.69, the model's predictions tend to be not very close from the actual label than near them.

Despite this being quite intuitive, the fact that multi car accidents cause the average amount of fatalities per crash to increase from 1.04deaths/crash (single car) to 1.13deaths/crash (multi crash), makes us think this factor’s contribution to the number of fatalities is statistically significant. We also noticed that across states rates of multi-car crashes vary drastically to a wide range of different factors. Perhaps this could be due to highway usage, how severe congestions are and if they occur at times when rates of drunk driving increase. Nevertheless as we see in the heat map, we see that there is a weak positive correlation between % multi-car and avg. fatalities per crash across states.

However one could argue that this insight is a little gamed, as an accident involving one person cannot have more than one fatality. Therefore it must be true that average fatalities of multi car accidents should be more than single-person accidents.  It was also interesting to see that unlike # cars, the majority of fatal accidents in the US involve more than one person whether it be the driver, passengers or non-motorists. This indicates a large swathe of crashes involve multiple passengers in the same car, or one car and non-motorists. ON the graphs we see a decent negative correlation between the % of multi-car accidents and the average fatality rate by state. Differences across states may be due to carpooling culture, or simply the average number of cars on the roads.

Moreover most states have either Friday, Saturday or Sunday as their deadliest days on the roads. The average number of fatalities per fatal crash also vary from day to day but the differences are less statistically significant however. Interestingly we also see days with highest average fatalities vary drastically from state to state. Despite the lack of additional data for each state, we can determine that there does not appear to be a geological effect on the day of the week with the highest average fatality rate by state. This can be seen as the days of the week appear randomly distributed across the US rather than creating patterns among regions.

This effect may be skewed by increased incidence of drunk driving during these months. Nevertheless, we see that the month has little effect on the number of fatalities per fatal crash.

Interestingly we also see that states with high concentrations of fatal crashes in rural areas typically don’t have the highest amount of fatalities per crash in rural areas. This nuance is also present for urban land uses. In the end, there needs to be much investigation into how land use may affect other contributing factors such as average speed, drunk driving frequency, traffic densities etc. that may cause the difference in average fatalities.

We see that for certain conditions like blowing sand that average fatalities per crash increase drastically. Although the number of crashes that occur in these conditions (as these conditions are more rare) are so low, these differences may not be statistically significant. This is reflected in the lack of correlation between the number of crashes in “unfavorable conditions” and the average number of fatalities per fatal crash. However we think this may simply be due to the flaw in the engineered feature of “unfavorable conditions” and also the sheer lack of frequency of truly dangerous weather conditions. This could also be due to the fact that there are less drivers on the road during these conditions and that drivers are much more cautious, naturally lowering the number of fatal accidents more than how these conditions contribute to fatal accidents.

Multi-car accidents tend to raise the average fatality rate per crash compared to single-car incidents, potentially influenced by congestion, varying highway usage, and potential instances of drunk driving. Additionally, accidents involving multiple individuals, drivers, passengers, or non-motorists significantly contribute to higher fatality counts. Temporal patterns indicate higher accident rates on weekends and warmer months, likely tied to better weather conditions, increased daylight, and unfortunately, higher instances of drunk driving. However, these temporal factors might not directly correlate with the number of fatalities per crash across states. Surprisingly, rural areas exhibit higher fatalities per crash despite lower population densities, prompting a need to delve deeper into land use dynamics affecting average driving speeds, drunk driving frequency, and traffic densities. While adverse weather conditions like blowing sand might increase average fatalities per crash, their infrequency and potentially cautious driving during these times might not yield significant statistical correlations. The presence of drunk drivers remains a robust determinant of fatalities, as does the promptness of emergency response, showing a close correlation with the average number of fatalities per state. Further exploration into road infrastructure quality, vehicle safety standards, driver behavior, and medical facility accessibility could provide additional insights into their respective contributions to average fatalities per accident, thus enhancing our understanding of road safety dynamics."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyP84sdwCjnfi3SgVDi4fYu9","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
